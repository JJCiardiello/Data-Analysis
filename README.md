# Data Analysis Portfolio
Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This is where I will upload any data analysis work I do. I'm still in the early stage of my programming journey, but as I go on this voyage of discovery I'll hopefully add more analyses and more succint code.

This portfolio currently contains 3 pieces of work.
